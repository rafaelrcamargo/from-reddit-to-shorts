# FRTS - From Reddit to Shorts

A simple script to scrape **Reddit** content and turn it into **shorts** content.

> [!important]
> This is a old experiment, a WIP that never really got to 100%. Proceed with caution!

## How It Works

- A script that scrapes Reddit content and bakes a short video.

## Installation

- The installation isn't too complicated, just follow the instructions below.
  We will be using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependencies.

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- To start using the script, just run the following command:

```bash
> python index.py
```

- Then the script will ask you for the subreddit you want to scrape, with that you the script will start scrapping the content and downloading the videos.

> [!tip]
> It works, may not be the most reliable thing in the world. But I think it can be of great value for folks looking to do something simmilar.
